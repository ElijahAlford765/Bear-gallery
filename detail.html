<p>The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic.</p>
<p>The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the oceanâ€“predominantly on the sea ice.</p>
<p>In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.</p>

<p>Considered talented swimmers, polar bears can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a rudder.</p>
<p>They have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that insulates them from the cold air and water.</p>
